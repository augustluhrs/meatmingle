# MEATMINGLE

A generative poetry ecosystem where participants create genital critters, "gennies", whose DNA is a line of poetry, and send them off to a poetry play party. When the gennies are lubed up enough and their refractory period is reset, they cruise around until they find another willing genny and ~~redacted~~ until a new little genny pops out whose DNA poem line is a cross of the parents'.
